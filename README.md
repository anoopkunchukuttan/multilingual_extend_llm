# Extending English Large Language Models to New Languages

Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency across a broad spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks exhibiting knowledge, common-sense and reasoning skills. While these LLMs perform well for English, their performance on non-English languages, particularly low-resources ones, is significantly lower. This highlights a significant challenge in extending their benefits to non-English languages. This repository looks at the technical challenges involved and various approaches in recent research to extend English LLMs to other languages and close the gap with English language performance.
